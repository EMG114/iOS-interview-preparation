# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Please use the following guidelines when contributing - 
* Figure out which section your question or recommended reading belongs to. If there is no appropriate section for it, file it under Miscellaneous.
* For contributing recommended reading articles, make sure that you have read it thoroughly yourself and find it useful and high quality.
* For contributing questions, make sure that one of the recommended readings covers answers or concepts that should help someone answer that question.

Thanks!
