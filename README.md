# iOS Interview Preparation Guide

A repository of iOS questions and recommended relevant blog posts on various aspects of iOS development.

Hopefully, this will be more useful than reading blog posts straight up, since knowing what questions could be asked on any topic provides more context and results in more mindful reading.

For anyone who practicing for an upcoming interview or even otherwise to just stay current.

Pull requests and suggestions to this repository are highly encouraged!
